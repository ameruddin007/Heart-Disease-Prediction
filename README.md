# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide predictive insights.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model performance metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
Run the following command to train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Making Predictions
Once trained, you can make predictions using:
```bash
python predict.py --input sample_data.csv
```

### Running the API (if applicable)
If the project includes a Flask API, start the server using:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then access predictions via:
```bash
http://localhost:5000/predict
```

## Model Performance
The model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC curve

## Future Improvements
- Enhance feature selection
- Test with different ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Learning)
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask for better accessibility
